# Python Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

## for Loop
Used to iterate over a sequence.

Example:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

## while Loop
Runs as long as a condition is True.

Example:
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

## Loop Control Statements
- break : exits the loop
- continue : skips the current iteration
