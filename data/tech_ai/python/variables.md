# Python Variables

A variable in Python is used to store data in memory.  
Variables are created when a value is assigned to a name.

Python is dynamically typed, meaning the variable type is inferred at runtime.

## Examples
x = 10
name = "Urvika"
is_active = True

## Rules
- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
- They cannot start with a number
- Python variables are case-sensitive

## Reassignment
x = 5
x = "hello"   # valid in Python
